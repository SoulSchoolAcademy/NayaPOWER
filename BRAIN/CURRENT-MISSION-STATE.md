## ALERT — MERGE-RECEIPT BREACH #121, BOARD-NUMBERED (VERIFY adjudication owed)
- PR #3155 "Domain move: functional nayanet.live -> nayanet.app" merged 2026-11-02T18:34:12Z
  (merge commit `ec6d0636`, head `62ea9db7`, merged_by SoulSchoolAcademy).
- 0 submitted reviews, NO 3-pass show-your-work receipt in the PR body, merged 8 minutes after
  creation against the body's own "DO NOT MERGE until different-seat scorecard" hold. Head CI:
  11 success / 8 failure / 1 skipped. Board-numbered #121 on #3066 (comment 6585331790, 18:44Z).
- NEW exact-main regression at ec6d0636 (auditor comment 6585685821, 18:58Z): Kernel Tests
  10 failed / 5,708 passed pre-merge -> 15 failed / 5,702 passed / 1 error post-merge. New failing
  family: tests/test_factory_standard_features.py — templates/personal.html changed while
  engine/templates-registry.json still pins the old md5. Spec Integrity (unpinned 0036/0037),
  Governed Production Promotion fail-closed, Current Truth Resolver CONFLICT, and the deploy
  health probe still targeting retired nayanet.live remain open. .app serving (HTTP + auth +
  share + Hub journeys) spot-verified for listed routes 20:42Z (6587982909); remaining seams: /about redirect, /joinus target, /pi 503 rows leg. Do not cite the domain ruling as Shawn's word;
  it rests on bot/board text, not verified Shawn bytes.

## TOP-10 (re-anchored to ec6d0636, board 1488)
1. Breach #121 + #119/#120 + #118 + #117 + #102-#116 repair + SN-1905 + SN-0843/0844 collision cures + SN-1908 adjudication
2. Direct-push disposition + builder re-proofs at tip + SN-2043 + SN-0858/0859/0860 + SN-0843/0844 mirror gap + 0038 tongues
3. Post-merge reds at ec6d0636 + Factory registry drift (personal.html vs templates-registry.json)
4. Alignment program execution
5. Emergency receipts
6. Done-proven gates + open PRs #3131/#3108/#3089/#2981, none merge-qualified
7. Serving chain + Auto-Match tap + .app mirror verified 20:42Z for listed routes (6587982909); remaining /about redirect, /joinus target, /pi 503 rows leg + identity-transfer DECISION owed to Shawn's hand (design verified 6587300858)
8. PI one-shot readiness
9. /PI overwrite/inventory/disclosure + marquee
10. Owner asks carried + queue 1,253 flat (153rd hour) + gh-api 401 reconnect (App identity used this tick) + SN-0834 deletion (Shawn's word) + capped-lane ruling + specialty-feed successors missing + safety-screen cause + weekly synthesis overdue + learning filing cure + value-ratio census 545:1 (1 verified outcome = domain ruling; 4 merges all breaches #118-#121)

## DONE WITH PROOF
- Tip steady at ec6d0636: no merge, no direct push in-window (tip unchanged).
- Board +2 accounted: .app mirror completion (6587982909: 48 entries on nayanet.app,
  listed routes spot-verified serving; exceptions /about redirect, /joinus target, /pi 503
  rows leg, all app-level for the deploy lanes) and hourly accountability (6588225991:
  0 dispatched/finished, queue 1,253 flat 153rd hour; open-PR census 4, #3108 new pin
  0d698743 branch push not merge). 0 relayed to naya2_to_builder (none builder-addressed);
  list stays at cap 20.
- Shared-state compacted: 167,265 bytes (< 200KB). Stored gh-api credential still 401
  (known since 2026-10-30); director reads via GitHub App identity this tick. Master directive:
  HAND_EDIT_DETECTED again this tick (exit 3) — no PATCH; lead reconciles; stale directive stands.

## BLOCKED WITH OWNER
- Breach #121 adjudication + retro-verification at ec6d0636: VERIFY/Verity owner.
- Factory registry drift (personal.html vs templates-registry.json): Resolve/#3155 owner + Smart Factory owner; byte-review before any digest reconciliation; registry-freshness regression test owed.
- .app seams (from PR #3155 body): workflow health target + heartbeat default still .live (needs a push route with Workflows permission) — owner: deploy/workflow owner; applied-migration supersede — owner: data-layer owner; .app subdomain DNS — owner: Nitro/deploy; Nitro off-repo deploy script repoint — owner: Nitro.
- Identity transfer to nayanet.app: DESIGN DONE + VERIFIED (6587300858, Phi spec
  team-nitro/identity-transfer/IDENTITY-TRANSFER-DESIGN-v1.md), but DECISION OWED TO SHAWN'S
  HAND (§5: 7 items incl (a)-vs-(b) choice, (b1)/(b2), abandoned-alias policy, ambassador-link
  disposition, server-change authorization). Implementation owner: Nitro; a different seat
  verifies. Until his word + implementation, Resolve mail ops on .app stay blocked on identity
  verification. Side warts stay in the repair stream: Hub Settings identity link still points at
  retiring nayanet.live/identity.html; entrance-host cert page still prints SMART LINK
  resolve.nayanet.live. Note: the domain ruling itself remains bot/board text, NOT verified
  Shawn bytes. (Routing note 6586754703: already raised to Shawn in chat.)
- Dispatcher queue: 1,253 items, flat for the 153rd hour (last evidenced 20:53Z); executor-side drain stall on capped lane feeds (#1713/#1714/#1715/#2471 at 2,500 comments, #2472 at 2,499).
- Master directive #2601: HAND_EDIT_DETECTED on this tick too (known hand-edit persists) — lead reconciles; stale directive stands.
